This project was for my Fall 2023 System Analysis and Design Class. 
Me and my group members created a system for Kumon Math and Reading Center of Northfield, NJ. 
During the project we were tasked to create a prototype for the system which I will share below:

Our prototype was on a website called Figma.
Also, this project has shown me but a glimpse of what System Analysis looks like. As well as how to use Visible Analyst, and myriad of other things as well. 
All in all, it was a good project.
